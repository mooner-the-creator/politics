# Proposal 1 - Harassment in Mainstream Media

## Problem
Harassment by third parties frequently occurs in mainstream media, often presented as lighthearted jokes under the guise of "dark humor." The issue is that those delivering "dark humor" may not fully understand why their jokes or ideas are harmful and cannot be perceived as mere jokes by everyone. Individuals who are sensitive or marginalized—whether due to disabilities or a lack of understanding of the subject matter—may internalize these negative messages, attempting to conform to societal standards rather than simply taking the joke.

## Solution
Prevent such media content from reaching end-users, regardless of whether the end-user belongs to a marginalized group.

## Proposition
Enact legislation that prohibits the non-educational portrayal of slurs or "dark humor" in media.

### Conditions
* **Legal:** An entertainment show includes an educational perspective on the harassment;<br>
  *Example:*<br>
  "She watched as he arrived, chilled to the bone by his words. 'Sorry, I don't date [Insert plural slur here],' he said before promptly leaving."

* **Illegal:** An educational show incorporates an entertainment-focused line;<br>
  *Example:*<br>
  "He wouldn't want her; he's a [Insert homophobic slur here]!"

**Understanding the Distinction:**<br>
The legality depends on the context in which the degrading language is used, not on the surrounding presentation. If the degrading term is part of an educational premise addressing harassment, it is permissible. However, using such terms for entertainment purposes without an educational context is prohibited.
